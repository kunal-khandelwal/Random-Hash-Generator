# Random-Hash-Generator
It is a simple random hash generator made using C++.
Random Hash are used in cryptography, simulations and sampling.
The program asks you the size of the hash and number of hashes you want to generate.

update_hash-
In this new update you can also select what kind of hash you want i.e. you can choose if you want alphabets or
alphabets+numbers or alphabets+numbers+ Capital aplhabets in your hash.
I hope my code helps you anyhow.

#screenshots are attached also#

# how to use-
Just download the cpp file and run it in your c++ compiler. 
You can also same algo in various other programmng languages.

Future scope-
Create a web application using HTML/CSS/JavaScript and create a good user interface that generate hash just like this program.
